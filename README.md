A quantitative research project in studying the effects of peer support with regards to rejection sensitivity within the Filipino LGB community living in the Philippines.

In the Philippines, the LGBT community continues to be very influential in this
day and age, however, there are still issues of victimization and prejudice. With this,
numerous factors play a role in the everyday stresses of their lives. Grounded on the
Minority Stress Theory and the Social-Buffering Model, the study examined the
relationship of rejection sensitivity, peer support, and suicidal ideation using a
correlational study involving 18 to 28-year-old Filipinos who self-identifies as
lesbian, gay, or bisexual.

Through the use of the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI),
Adult Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (A-RSQ), and The Network of
Relationships Inventoryâ€”Relationship Quality Version (NRI-RQV), data was
collected from 319 LGB individuals (43 lesbians, 66 gays and 210 bisexuals) and
determined a relationship between, (i) rejection sensitivity and suicidal ideation, (ii)
peer support and rejection sensitivity, and (iii) peer support and suicidal ideation. It
was then determined if rejection sensitivity and peer support predicts suicidal
ideation.

Correspondingly, it showed that there was a significantly positive
relationship between rejection sensitivity and suicidal ideation. Whereas, a
significantly negative relationship was found between peer support and rejection
sensitivity, and between peer support and suicidal ideation. Furthermore, it was
found that rejection sensitivity, as well as peer support, was a predictor of suicidal
ideation. However, rejection sensitivity predicted suicidal ideation better than peer
support.
